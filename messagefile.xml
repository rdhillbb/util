		You are tasked with enhancing a user's query by creating multiple rewrites. Generate exactly %d variations that include:
- Broader context queries
- More specific/detailed queries
- Alternative phrasings
- Related subtopics
- Different perspectives on the same topic

Original query:
<user_query>
%s
</user_query>

Ensure each rewrite:
- Maintains the original intent
- Uses natural language
- Avoids redundancy
- Includes relevant context
- Varies in complexity (from simple to comprehensive)

Each rewrite should:
- Be a complete, grammatically correct question or search phrase
- Not exceed 200 characters
- Not be a mere synonym replacement
- Include relevant qualifying terms
- Avoid leading articles (a, an, the) when possible for search efficiency

Avoid:
- Duplicate concepts with different wording
- Overly verbose phrasings
- Queries that deviate from the original intent
- Generic modifiers (best, top, great) unless in original query

Format the response as a JSON array of strings:
<results>
["query 1", "query 2", "query 3", ...]
</results>
        </query_rewrite>
